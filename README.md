# Ingenico Connect Ruby SDK

## Introduction

The Ruby SDK helps you to communicate with the [Ingenico Connect](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/) Server API. Its primary features are:

* convenient Ruby library for the API calls and responses
    * marshalls Ruby request objects to HTTP requests
    * unmarshalls HTTP responses to Ruby response objects or Ruby exceptions
* handling of all the details concerning authentication
* handling of required meta data

Its use is demonstrated by an example for each possible call. The examples execute a call using the provided API keys. 

See the [Ingenico Connect Developer Hub](https://epayments.developer-ingenico.com/documentation/sdk/server/ruby/) for more information on how to use the SDK.

## Structure of this repository

This repository consists out of four main components:

1. The source code of the SDK itself: `/lib/ingenico/connect/sdk/`
2. The source code of the SDK unit tests: `/spec/lib/`
3. The source code of the SDK integration tests: `/spec/integration/`
4. Usage examples: `/examples/`

Note that the source code of the unit tests, integration tests and the examples can only be found on GitHub.

## Requirements

Ruby 2.3 or higher is required.
As for JRuby, version 9.0.0.0 and higher are supported.
In addition, the following packages are required:

* [httpclient](https://github.com/nahi/httpclient) 2.8 or higher
* [concurrent-ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) 1.0 or higher

## Installation

### Using RubyGems

To install the SDK using `gem`, execute the following command:

    gem install connect-sdk-ruby

### Using a pre-built gem

1. Download the latest version of the Ruby SDK from GitHub. Choose the `connect-sdk-ruby-x.y.z.gem` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-ruby/releases) page, where `x.y.z` is the version number.
2. Navigate into the folder where the gem file is downloaded to, and execute the following command:

    ```
    gem install connect-sdk-ruby-x.y.z.gem
    ```
3. Feel free to delete the gem file at this point, it is no longer required.

### From source

1. Download the latest version of the Ruby SDK from GitHub. Choose the `connect-sdk-ruby-x.y.z.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/Ingenico-ePayments/connect-sdk-ruby/releases) page, where `x.y.z` is the version number.
2. Unzip the file, navigate into the folder where the file is unzipped to, and execute the following commands:

    ```
    gem build connect-sdk-ruby.gemspec
    gem install connect-sdk-ruby-x.y.z.gem
    ```
3. Feel free to delete the unzipped archive, the zip file and the gem file at this point, they are no longer required.

## Uninstalling

After the Ruby SDK has been installed, it can be uninstalled using the
following command:

    gem uninstall connect-sdk-ruby

The required packages can be uninstalled in the same way.

## Usage

After the Ruby SDK has been installed, it can be required in Ruby program as follows:

    require 'ingenico/connect/sdk'

## Running tests

There are two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests. The unit tests will work out-of-the-box; for the integration tests some configuration is required.
First, some environment variables need to be set:

* `connect_api_apiKeyId` for the API key id to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect_api_secretApiKey` for the secret API key to use. This can be retrieved from the Configuration Center.
* `connect_api_merchantId` for your merchant ID.

In addition, to run the proxy integration tests, the proxy URI, username and password should be set in the `spec/fixtures/resources/properties.proxy.yml` file.

In order to run the unit and integration tests, some additional dependencies are required:

* [rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) 12.3.3 or higher
* [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) 3.5 or higher
* [webmock](https://github.com/bblimke/webmock) 2.1 or higher
* [sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) 2.1 or higher
* [webrick](https://github.com/ruby/webrick) 1.7 or higher

They can be installed using the following command:

    gem install rake rspec webmock sinatra

*Note: if rake is already installed as part of the Ruby installation, this will cause a conflict error. This can safely be ignored.*

The following commands can now be executed from the root directory of the SDK folder (/) to execute the tests:

* Unit tests:

    ```
    rake unit
    ```

* Integration tests:

    ```
    rake integration
    ```

* Both unit and integration tests:

    ```
    rake spec
    ```

## Generating documentation

Documentation can be generated with YARD. YARD can be installed as a gem. The gems required to generate documentation are:

* [rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) 12.3.3 or higher
* [yard](https://github.com/lsegal/yard) 0.9.5 or higher

They can be installed using the following command:

    gem install rake yard

*Note: if rake is already installed as part of the Ruby installation, this will cause a conflict error. This can safely be ignored.*

Once YARD and rake are installed, documentation can be generated with the following command (ran from the root folder):

    rake yard

Documentation will be generated in the `/doc` folder. The file `/doc/index.html` is the main documentation file.
